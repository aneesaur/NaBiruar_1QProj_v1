    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger is a group that advocates for Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.
        It began with conversations among friends, still high school students, that started off as sharing about their favorite food at
        their last dinner session together and ended as understanding not only their privileges but their capability. After several
        discussions with one another, they finally came to an agreement that they could no longer just sit still, enjoy, and feel bad;
        they wanted to help, too.</p>
    <p>For high school students, taking real action to actively support the battle against hunger would be a difficult movement to keep
        up with, but they did not let that stop them. There were many ways to partake in the fight and they decided that working to
        publicly promote Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, through gathering and sharing information online, was not so hard
        at all, especially knowing what real people are going through in real time. NoughtHungry hopes to not only educate individuals
        but to inspire them to take their own initiative as well, until all of this reaches people who can bring change and through them
        we can extend our arms to the people who have suffered.</p>

    <p>There lives a girl who loves to eat heartily, but cannot stand the fact that there are others her age, younger, and even older who
        did not have the privilege to eat at all. As a small child, she would take out as many little coins as she could find from the
        compartments of her family car before getting off for school, because she knew that on the streets outside, just by the walls of
        her campus, there were people who sat on the rough, hard ground, waiting day and night for even just one peso’s worth of donations
        to put in their cups. She would later grow up to become a scholar of Philippine Science High School, studying in its Southern
        Mindanao campus, where she would soon realize that her thoughts and her voice could have an impact on the world if she wanted it
        to. Born with compassion and developing further skills in service through experiences in teamwork and organizations, Aneesa Fareedah
        B. Biruar aims to become an individual who can not just bring light to the issue of hunger, but also to how even just one individual
        can support the fight against it. We have voices, so let us speak up for those who cannot.</p>

    <p>Across the world, 29% face food insecurity. You could be a one-in-bllions who is lucky
        enough to have three meals on your table every day, or a one-in-billions who struggles to
        take even the smallest bite. Whoever you may be, you matter, and you have a place in this
        world. You can make a difference.</p>
