        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger (NH: FZH) began with annual Christmas food-gifting by a group
            of Filipino high school students to people on the sides of the streets, handing out bags
            upon bags of packaged homemade meals and bottles of water. After two years of this tradition,
            they decided they wanted to make bigger impact on the issue of hunger and established NH: FZH
            as an independent organization, promoting their cause online and starting up initiatives
            such as food drive donations. In the same year of the foundation of the organization, its
            members were able to organize three community outreaches in Davao City, providing nutritious
            meals and snacks for the beneficiaries and sharing with them simple but crucial information
            on nutrition.</p>
        <p>By the time the founding members graduated high school, NH: FZH attained significant traction
            nationwide, gaining not only supporters but also donators and sponsors, allowing for the
            expansion of the organization to reach a wider audience and to make greater change. In the
            present day, NH: FZH remains as an organization built on compassion and care, continuing
            and improving its initial programs alongside new ones for the benefit of the people. Christmas
            or not, the members of NH: FZH will always be there to serve.</p>

        <p>As humbly as one can admit this, I have always been full of empathy. Even as a kid, I found
            myself creating “shops” that sold paper crafts to earn money to hand to the beggars on the
            pavement outside of my school. Back then though, my belief in what one small person like
            me could to make a change was limited. Once I began attending Philippine Science High School
            and saw my peers and my seniors, I realized something important: The distance away from my
            aspirations is nothing greater than my ambition to share my compassion. That is what got
            me to where I am now and made me who I am now, Aneesa Fareedah B. Biruar, the founder of
            NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger and advocating for one of the largest concerns in the world,
            accessibility of food.</p>
