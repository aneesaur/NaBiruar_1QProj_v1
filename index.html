    <h1>NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger</h1>
    <p>NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger advocates for the sustainability of water and food resources around the world, speaking up on
        Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger for those who cannot. Through sharing verified information and data on the problem
        and promoting organizations that act in real time to combat hunger, NoughtHungry strives to shed light on the issue and garner
        support for everyone from everyone. We believe that this is a fight not just for one person or a few countries, but a fight for
        everyone to protect all lives.</p>

    <h2>Key Information</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Hunger, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), is the “uncomfortable or painful physical
        sensation caused by insufficient consumption of dietary energy.” Due to food insecurity, physical distress occurs in the body,
        which could lead to further problems. Internationally, three hundred nineteen (319) million individuals are challenged with acute
        hunger for several reasons such as inequity, conflict, and poverty. Nationally, in the Philippines, in early 2025, the rate of
        hunger reached 27.2%, based on reports on involuntary hunger in families.</p>
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>The Global Hunger Index (GHI) as of 2024 indicates that, out of the one hundred twenty-seven (127) countries with sufficient data
        to calculate GHI, forty-two (42) struggle with hunger, even with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United
        Nations, indicating a severe lack of progress in reaching Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger and implying that the
        future ahead might not be what we need.</p>

    <h3>Importance of Understanding</h3>
    <p>Understanding hunger is a crucial step in creating a better future for everyone. It is a
        continual major issue in the globe, constantly affecting individuals all over the world.
        We should understand that we are never at peace while there are others who still suffer
        when they should not. As humans, we live, breathe, and feel together; leaving someone
        behind just because we are ahead is not right.</p>
    <h3>Active Initiatives Against</h3>
    <p>Under the United Nations, the organization created with the aim of world peace and prosperity, the Food and Agriculture
        Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) both serve as humanitarian organizations that work toward the eradication
        of hunger globally. Their cause is also under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan instated by the United Nations
        to ascertain global development, as Goal 2: Zero Hunger. Another international organization in the fight is Action Against Hunger,
        which researches and treats affected areas all around the globe through efficient projects to make a real difference.</p>
    <p>In the past, the international movement Rise Against Hunger has contributed to the food security of the Philippines through
        dietary supplementation programs, the first food bank in the country, a mobile kitchen that travels about in Metro Manila, aiding in
        establishing projects to sustain agriculture and livelihood in the long run, and much more. Furthermore, another organization,
        Action Against Hunger, has its own branch in the Philippines moving toward the same goal of eliminating hunger through prevention,
        detection, and treatment of malnutrition in the country. The Philippines also established its own Food Strategic Transfer and
        Alternative Measures Program (Food STAMP), Walang Gutom 2027, wherein low-income households are guaranteed access to food through
        electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards that contain three thousand pesos (3,000 PhP)’s worth of food credits, to be used to
        obtain food products from partner merchants.</p>

    <h2>Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger</h2>
    <p>Established in 2015 along with the rest of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2:
        Zero Hunger aims for a world free of hunger by 2030. According to recent data and statistics, progress has been made, although
        at a concerningly slow rate, and issues have arisen that have set us back, but we should not lose hope. So long as we bring
        ourselves together in union now and onward, Zero Hunger and the 2030 Agenda will not be far from the sights we have set for
        the future of the globe.</p>
