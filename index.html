        <h1>NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger</h1>
        <p>NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger (NH: FZH) is a Philippines-based organization that advocates
            for the accessibility of food through raising awareness by sharing credible information and
            resources to the world and taking real action in our country. Aligned with Sustainable
            Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, we aim to make a change and eliminate malnutrition, in
            our country and in the world. We promote, support, and collaborate with organizations in
            the same path and we take our own steps to contribute to the cause in the Philippines. In
            our hearts, we firmly believe that each plate matters and the struggle against hunger is
            not just for one or a few, but for all of us. Together, we strive to make a change and advanced
            to a healthier and safer future, for everyone.</p>

            <summary>Defining Hunger</summary>
            <span>
                <p>As humans, food is a necessity to function. Food is what stimulates our growth, providing
                    energy and nutrition, our essentials in survival. However, global statistics sourced
                    from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that in the years 2021 to 2023, a number
                    of around 713 to 757 million people were reported to be undernourished and in 2023,
                    a number of 2.3 billion people were reported to have faced food insecurity. In the
                    same report, it is stated that global progress toward Sustainable Development Goal
                    2: Zero Hunger has been set back by fifteen years. Should these patterns continue,
                    a severely concerning number of people around the world will be chronically undernourished
                    and following them will be extreme consequences.</p>
                <p>Hunger, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is “an uncomfortable
                    or painful physical sensation caused by insufficient consumption of dietary energy.”
                    Despite the 2030 Agenda set by the United Nations in 2015, the Global Hunger Index
                    (GHI), at a score of 18.3 in 2024, indicates that the change that we need to see
                    is most likely far away from 2030 and anytime else in the near future. Additionally,
                    out of the 127 countries used to measure the GHI, 42 continue to struggle with hunger
                    at serious and worse levels. The GHI is only one of many factors warning us not only of
                    the current state of global hunger, but also of the consequences should inaction
                    and injustice continue. Long-term undernutrition comes with several side effects
                    that can greatly change the life of a person for the worse and when they reach a
                    certain level, these side effects can be genetically passed on to future generations,
                    causing damage that is extremely difficult to reverse.</p>

            <span>
                <p>Globally, the largest organization that caters to food accessibility is the World
                    Food Programme (WFP), a branch of the United Nations dedicated to food assistance.
                    Aside from providing emergency assistance and relief to afflicted countries, they
                    take part in the development of sustainable agriculture. Another noteworthy organization
                    is the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a specialized agency also under the
                    United Nations that works toward food security. There are multiple more institutions
                    that have the same goal, with different systems and specifications of service. These
                    efforts are one collaboration to address a significant concern and achieve a crucial
                    goal that will always matter, not just to them or the people they serve, but to the
                    entire human race.</p>

        <h2>Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger</h2>
        <p>In 2015, the United Nations instated the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in coordination
            with the 2030 Agenda, aiming for peace and prosperity. Among them, SDG 2: Zero Hunger stands
            as the call-to-action for food security, proper nutrition, and improved agriculture. Hunger
            is a concern all around the world and as global citizens, it is our responsibility to acknowledge it.</p>

        <p>There are those who have the voices to speak up and the hands to take action and there are
            those who are silenced and chained. You may eat three complete, nutritious meal each day
            with dessert at the end and you may barely manage to grab for a few bites. At the end of the day,
            we are all human and we all want to survive.

            A meal is best shared. Eat well. Eat together.</p>
